#### Version 2

In Version 2 of the Tic Tac Toe code the program is designed to accept inputs only from Player 1.  
Player 2 is considered as a bot to automatically select a random space on the grid.  
Both players take turns until there is a winner or a tied game.

If either player selects a number that has already been taken on the grid an error message will be displayed prompting the same player to try again.
