#### Version 1 

In Version 1 of the Tic Tac Toe code the program is designed to accept inputs from Player 1 and Player 2. For example, You are playing Tic Tac Toe cooperatively with a sibling. Player 1 chooses a space on the grid. Then the next input prompt will be for Player 2 to decide. Both players take turns until there is a winner or a tied game. 

If a player inputs a number that has already been taken on the grid an error message will be displayed prompting the same player to try again. 


#### Version 2

In Version 2 of the Tic Tac Toe code the program is designed to accept inputs only from Player 1.  
Player 2 is considered as a bot to automatically select a random space on the grid.  
Both players take turns until there is a winner or a tied game.

If either player selects a number that has already been taken on the grid an error message will be displayed prompting the same player to try again.
